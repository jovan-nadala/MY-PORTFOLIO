        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Problem Solving</li> <p>"As a computer engineering student, I've developed good problem-solving skills by working through different challenges. I like to take big problems and break them into smaller, easier parts to solve. Whether it's coding, fixing bugs, or working with hardware, I can quickly find and fix issues. I'm always trying to get better, and I enjoy working with others and learning new things." </p>
            <li>Adaptability</li><p>"As a computer engineering student, I’ve developed strong adaptability skills that help me handle new challenges, whether it’s learning new technologies, picking up a programming language, or adjusting to project changes. I’m quick to adjust my approach and always find solutions. My flexibility allows me to work well independently or in a team, and I’m always eager to learn and grow."</p>
            <li>Teamwork/Collaboration</li><p>"As a computer engineering student, I’ve worked on a lot of group projects, and I’ve learned how important teamwork is. I enjoy sharing ideas, listening to others, and doing my part to help the team succeed. I believe good communication is key, and I make sure everyone’s voice is heard. Whether it’s solving a tough problem or splitting up tasks, I always focus on working together to get things done. I love learning from others and sharing what I know to help the team."</p>
            <li>Communication Skills</li><p>"As a computer engineering student, I’ve worked on improving my communication skills to make sure I can explain technical ideas in a simple and clear way. Whether I'm talking with teammates, presenting a project, or writing reports, I focus on making sure my message comes across easily. I also make sure to listen carefully and ask questions so everyone is on the same page. I believe good communication is key to solving problems and working well with others, and I always try to keep things open and positive in group settings."</p>
